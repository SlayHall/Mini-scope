This repository contains the code and resources for building a low-cost oscilloscope using a Raspberry Pi Pico and a custom Android application. The project leverages MicroPython for firmware development and Android Studio for the app, enabling real-time visualization of waveforms.

Features:
Real-Time Data Acquisition: Receives voltage readings from the Raspberry Pi Pico via TCP protocol.

Waveform Visualization: Displays waveforms on a line chart with dynamic X-axis scaling for enhanced analysis.

Signal Analysis: Calculates and displays peak-to-peak voltage and duty cycle metrics.

User Interaction: Intuitive controls for starting/stopping data visualization and adjusting display parameters.
